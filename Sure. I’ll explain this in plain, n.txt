Sure. I’ll explain this **in plain, non-jargon language**, and also show **how it connects to the rest of your system**.

---

## Why do we need an **Auditor / Anchor-Verifier** service?

Think of anchoring like **printing a receipt and locking it in a public vault** (the blockchain).

Once that receipt is locked:

* You **cannot change it**
* Anyone can later **check that it’s real**

But **how do we check it later?**

That’s exactly what the **anchor-verifier** does.

---

## Simple real-world analogy

Imagine this flow:

1. 📦 A factory creates a product
2. 🧾 A summary of that product’s history is written on paper
3. 🔒 That paper is locked in a public locker (blockchain)
4. 🕵️‍♂️ Months later, someone asks:

   > “Did this product *really* come from that factory?”

The **anchor-verifier**:

* Takes the product history again
* Re-creates the summary
* Checks if it matches what’s inside the public locker

If it matches → ✅ **Genuine**
If it doesn’t → ❌ **Tampered**

---

## What problem does the anchor-verifier solve?

Without it:

* You **trust the system blindly**
* You can’t independently prove data wasn’t changed

With it:

* Anyone can **verify truth without trusting anyone**
* Auditors, regulators, customers all get **proof**

---

## What exactly does the Anchor-Verifier do?

In simple steps:

1. 📥 Receives a verification request
   (example: “Verify product X”)

2. 📂 Fetches the original data
   (from database / IPFS / object storage)

3. 🧮 Re-calculates the fingerprint
   (same way validator did earlier)

4. 🔗 Fetches blockchain record
   (the stored fingerprint)

5. 🔍 Compares both fingerprints

6. 📤 Returns result

   * ✔ Valid (data unchanged)
   * ❌ Invalid (data altered)

## How is it connected to other services?

Let’s walk through the **full story**.

---

### 1️⃣ Ingest Service

➡️ Collects raw supply-chain data
➡️ Sends it for validation

```
Ingest Service
   |
   v
```

---

### 2️⃣ Validator

➡️ Checks data format and rules
➡️ Creates a **Merkle root** (fingerprint)

```
Validator
   |
   v
```

---

### 3️⃣ Anchoring Scheduler

➡️ Groups many fingerprints together
➡️ Decides *when* to anchor them

```
Anchoring Scheduler
   |
   v
```

---

### 4️⃣ Anchor Service

➡️ Writes fingerprint to blockchain
➡️ Gets transaction hash + block number

```
Anchor Service
   |
   v
```

---

### 5️⃣ Indexer

➡️ Reads blockchain events
➡️ Saves anchor info in database

```
Indexer
   |
   v
```

---

### 6️⃣ Query Service

➡️ Exposes data via API / GraphQL
➡️ Used by frontend & admin tools

```
Query Service
```

---

### ⭐ 7️⃣ Auditor / Anchor-Verifier (your question)

This service **does NOT write anything**.

It only **checks**.

It connects to:

* 📦 **Storage** → to fetch original data
* 🗄 **Query Service / DB** → to get anchor metadata
* 🔗 **Blockchain node** → to read stored fingerprint

```
User / Auditor
   |
   v
Anchor-Verifier
   |        |        |
   v        v        v
 Storage   Query   Blockchain
```

---

## Why keep Anchor-Verifier separate?

Because:

* 🔒 It must be **neutral**
* 🔍 It must work even if other services are compromised
* 🧾 Auditors want a **read-only verifier**
* ⚖ Regulators don’t trust “internal services”

This separation gives **credibility**.

---

## Who uses Anchor-Verifier?

* External auditors
* Compliance teams
* Customers verifying product authenticity
* Internal investigations
* Automated anomaly agents

---

## What happens if verifier says “invalid”?

That’s a **big red flag** 🚨

It means:

* Data was modified
* Or wrong data is being presented
* Or someone tried to cheat

This triggers:

* Alerts
* Incident workflows
* Compliance review

---

## One-line summary

> **Anchor-Verifier proves that stored data has not changed since it was permanently recorded on the blockchain.**

It’s the **truth-checker** of your entire platform.

If you want next:

* I can give **NestJS + TypeScript code** for `auditor-verifier`
* Or a **diagram**
* Or show **exact API endpoints** it should expose

Just say the word.
